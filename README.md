# novena-40mm-blower-mount
3D CAD / printable files for mounting a 40mm horizontal blower inside the Novena peek array to cool the CPU and FPGA

I am using a Delta Brushless horizontal blower, model number BFB0408HHA but many similar parts exist.

## Blower dimensions
* Overall 40mm x 40mm x 10mm
* Mounting holes:
  * 35.0+/-0.3mm square spacing
  * 2.4+/-0.3mm through hole
* Apertuire 28.0 mm opening on one face

Since the blower is on 40mm spacing and the peek array is on 30mm spacing, the blower mount will require 4 array squares. This is actually kind of convenient because it gives us liberty to slide the blower around within the array and angle it as desired.
